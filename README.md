# socialThoughtBubble
A functional backend for a social media app allowing users to add friends and share/edit their thoughts.

## Description
Backend functionality for a user-responsive social media app that allows users to share their thoughts, react to posted thought(s), and add other users as their friends! To attract users to this app, we have integrated the flexibility to be able to add, update, and delete their user account details, their thoughts, reactions, and friends!  Because the app has been built using a MongoDB database & structured with Mongoose.js, data is passed to accomodate more functionality as the client sees fit, now and in future developments.
